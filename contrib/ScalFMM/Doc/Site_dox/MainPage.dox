 * \section overV Overview
 *
 * ScalFMM is a software/library to simulate N-body interactions using
 * the Fast Multipole Method. This is a <b>kernel independent fast multipole
method</b> based on interpolation ( Chebyshev or Lagrange). 
 * 
 * The library offers two methods to compute interactions between
 * bodies when the potential decays like 1/r. The first method is the
 * classical FMM based on spherical harmonic expansions and the second is
 * the Black-Box method which is an independent kernel formulation
 * (introduced by E. Darve @ Stanford). With this method, we can now
 * easily add new non oscillatory kernels in our library. For the
 * classical method, two approaches are used to decrease the complexity
 * of the operators. We consider either matrix formulation that allows us
 * to use BLAS routines or rotation matrices to speed up the M2L
 * operator.
 *
 * ScalFMM intends to offer all the functionalities needed to perform
 * large parallel simulations while enabling an easy customization of
 * the simulation components: kernels, particles and cells. It works
 * in parallel in a shared/distributed memory model using OpenMP and
 * MPI. The software architecture has been designed with two major
 * objectives: being easy to maintain and easy to understand. There is
 * two main parts: 
 * <ul> 
 * <li> the management of the octree and the
 * parallelization of the method; </li> 
 * <li> The kernels. This new
 * architecture allow us to easily add new FMM algorithm or kernels
 * and new paradigm of parallelization. </li> 
 * </ul>

 * library.
